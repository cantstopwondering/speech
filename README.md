## A letter to the EOS holders

Dear all helpless EOS holders, 

  Do you still have confidence in EOS? Do you still be patient with EOS and Block.one? Do you have a bunch of complaints to say? We present you SPEECH!

  In SPEECH, you can say anything you want, we forward every words you said to b1. And meanwhile, your speech is golden, every time you make a speech,Â  you earn some SPEECH coins. More words, more coin. More saying, more coin.

  Oh, one more thing: In past few days, first it's CPU mining, then RAM mining, it makes you can't stop wondering: why not NET? NET is the cheapest resource between these three. How about make some Roast of EOS/B1, and meantime using NET to mine some coin? This is natural, right?

## So here comes the rules:
1. Everyone can say something, it's a free blockchain world. 
2. We can think this as a warm up of VOICE.
3. More words, more coin, coin doubled when words is multiple of 500 byte, no upper bound.
4. If speech time is continuous (you don't miss every block), more coin.
5. You can only make one speech in one block.
6. Every transaction, miner get 70% coin, contract get 30% coin.
7. Every speech miner says, we forward it to b1.
8. Total supply of SPEECH is 100 million, just like B1's tokens in EOS.
9. The reward start from 4 SPEECH each block, decrease progressively every 5 million, the decrease factor is 1.2. 
10. You can making speech starts from UTC 2019-12-06 12:00:00.

## How to make speech, and earn SPEECH:
1. Wait for UTC 2019-12-06 12:00:00.

2. Just say words start with `Hi Block.one:`.
```
cleos push action speechforeos say '["my_account", "Hi Block.one:I WANT TO SAY THAT..."]' -p my_account
